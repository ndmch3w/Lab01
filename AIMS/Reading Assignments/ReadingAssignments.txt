1. When should accessor methods be used?
-> By restricting access to and modification of an object's data, accessor methods can aid in protecting its integrity. You can ensure that the object's state is accessed and changed in a secure and regulated manner while still allowing other sections of your application to interact with it by providing getters and setters. When you need to add some form of validation or error checking on the input values that are being set, accessor methods can be helpful. Generally speaking, you should use accessor methods anytime you wish to grant controlled access to an object's state and when you need to preserve the integrity of that state by validating or checking the input values.
